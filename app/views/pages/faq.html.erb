	<h2>How does sailing help to unify a team, or teach leadership?</h2>
	<p>
		To navigate a waterway efficiently on a sailing vessel takes cooperation
		of crew and captain. All pieces must function together in order to “make way”
		(progress forward). Of course, every group is different and is looking to
		achieve specific goals. We will work with you and your organization to
		custom tailor a program that can reinforce your team building/leadership
		building goals in a nautical setting.
	</p>
	<h2>Does this type of training really stimulate growth?</h2>
	<p>
		Yes. Sailing efficiently is a challenge in a new, exciting environment for
		most people. Teammates will develop a stronger sense of their place in the
		overall function of your organization, as well as see each other in a more
		personal light. However, it is needless to say that the team must be perceptive
		and willing to engage in this learning experience!
	</p>
	<h2>What are the risks associated with this type of program?</h2>
	<p>
		The Channel Islands Center for Leadership and Team Building puts safety first
		in every aspect of our regimen. We do not take risks; the purpose of our program
		is learning with enjoyment. Additionally, Captain Jon Rock is USCG-certified in
		all areas of yachting safety and navigation, and with 10 years of experience
		behind the helm.
	</p>
	<p>
		The only precaution we request is for individuals taking part in our program to
		ask their physician if any preexisting health conditions they may have would
		inhibit a safe day at sea. For example: pregnant women far along in their term,
		those with heart conditions, epilepsy, etc.
	</p>
	<p>
		Seasickness is a harmless, but real condition that may present itself on
		occasion with clients. We ask those with a history of seasickness/motion
		sickness to take any necessary anti-motion sickness medication at least
		one hour before departure. Once again, please consult your physician for
		what options are best for you.
