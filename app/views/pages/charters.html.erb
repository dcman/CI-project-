				BWhat better way to enjoy Channel Islands National Park than from 
				the deck of your own private yacht? The Santa Barbara Channel, 
				which runs between mainland California and Santa Cruz Island, 
				offers pristine sunsets, affable wildlife, and beautiful coastline. 
				Interestingly, this area is home to the greatest diversity of 
				cetaceans (whales and dolphins) than any other place on earth. 
				Sea lions and dozens of species of sea birds are also regular 
				visitors. The Channel Islands Center for Leadership and Team 
				Building can help you explore these sights on your very own vessel 
				with friends, family, or coworkers.</span></font>

				For a group family and friends, almost nothing compares to a day 
				on the water. Young and old alike can take pleasure in a breath-taking 
				sail along the rugged California coast, accompanied by native dolphin 
				riding along the bow wave of your majestic sailing vessel. Teach 
				your kids the value of self-sufficiency at sea, learning the basics 
				of navigation and safe seamanship. Open their eyes to a world beyond 
				the television set, and experience firsthand the wonders of the sea. 
				Your own personal USCG-certified Captain will instruct you on seafaring 
				basics; or, you may relax and just take in the many sights that the 
				Channel Islands have to offer.<br />

				Perhaps your employees need to be rewarded for a job well done, and 
				you would like to give them the trip of a lifetime. No previous sailing 
				experience is necessary, as you will be accompanied by your own 
				USCG-certified Captain aboard a gorgeous Beneteau 40â€™ sloop. Relax 
				with wine and hors d'oeuvres, watch the sunset, and gawk at the local 
				wildlife and remote island coastline. Or, if you prefer a more hands-on 
				approach, you may help the captain navigate for a more active day at sea.<br /><br />
