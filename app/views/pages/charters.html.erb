	<h2>Sailing Charters</h2>
	<p>
		What better way to enjoy Channel Islands National Park than from
		the deck of your own private yacht? The Santa Barbara Channel,
		which runs between mainland California and Santa Cruz Island,
		offers pristine sunsets, affable wildlife, and beautiful coastline.
		Interestingly, this area is home to the greatest diversity of
		cetaceans (whales and dolphins) than any other place on earth.
		Sea lions and dozens of species of sea birds are also regular
		visitors. The Channel Islands Center for Leadership and Team
		Building can help you explore these sights on your very own vessel
		with friends, family, or coworkers.
	</p>
	<h2>Day Charter for Family</h2>
	<p>
		For a group family and friends, almost nothing compares to a day
		on the water. Young and old alike can take pleasure in a breath-taking
		sail along the rugged California coast, accompanied by native dolphin
		riding along the bow wave of your majestic sailing vessel. Teach
		your kids the value of self-sufficiency at sea, learning the basics
		of navigation and safe seamanship. Open their eyes to a world beyond
		the television set, and experience firsthand the wonders of the sea.
		Your own personal USCG-certified Captain will instruct you on seafaring
		basics; or, you may relax and just take in the many sights that the
		Channel Islands have to offer.

	<h2>Day Charter for Businesses</h2>
	<p>
		Perhaps your employees need to be rewarded for a job well done, and
		you would like to give them the trip of a lifetime. No previous sailing
		experience is necessary, as you will be accompanied by your own
		USCG-certified Captain aboard a gorgeous Beneteau 40â€™ sloop. Relax
		with wine and hors d'oeuvres, watch the sunset, and gawk at the local
		wildlife and remote island coastline. Or, if you prefer a more hands-on
		approach, you may help the captain navigate for a more active day at sea.
