	<font face="Verdana"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: black"> At Channel Islands Center for Leadership and Team building, we believe
			that people learn best through hands-on participation in a challenging
			environment. Learning is most effective when actually experienced
			firsthand. Additionally, each team member gains self-awareness through
			reflection on one's own behavior, feedback from others, and by experimenting
			with new ways of approaching a particular goal.
			<br />
			Sailing involves realistic and demanding activity that allows the concepts
			of leadership and teamwork to become apparent to members of the group. We
			build up an open, supportive atmosphere, in which leaders and team members
			can take risks, and learn to develop their attitude and skills. Such an
			atmosphere supports each individual's personal growth and reinforces the
			goals of the organization. </span></font>

			attempting to bring the most current understanding of:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 9px; margin-bottom: 9px">
						<font face="Verdana">How to form and evaluate a group's commitment to the values of their
							organization. </font>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 9px; margin-bottom: 9px">
						<font face="Verdana">To determine the levels of trust among each team member. </font>
					</p>

				<li>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 9px; margin-bottom: 9px">
						<font face="Verdana">The team's willingness to be held accountable
							for the goals of the organization. </font>
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul> In providing the facilitation for these trainings we have discovered that
			it is critical to get the “right people on the bus and in the best seats.”
			<br />
			<br />
			Having a Leadership Consultant working with the executive learning team
			often helps the team to see how the unintended ripple of one team member
			can change the direction of and spirit of the entire team. The conversation
			begins with a simple question, “Where are we going?”  During the day that
			question will be answered along with the question, “Who will share this
			journey with me?”  Try thinking about how you would respond to those
			questions as one of you, in the role of captain, attempts to bring the
			yacht “about.”  We promise an exhilarating experience, the beginning
			transformation of your executive team and a level of sailing activity
			that will build an institutional memory to last a lifetime. </span></font>
