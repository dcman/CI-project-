				<font face="Verdana">	At Channel Islands Center for Leadership and
					Team building, we believe that people learn best through hands-on
					participation in a challenging environment. Learning is most effective
					when actually experienced firsthand. Additionally, each team member
					gains self-awareness through reflection on one's own behavior, feedback
					from others, and by experimenting with new ways of approaching a
					particular goal.</font>
			</p>
			<p>
				<font face="Verdana">	Sailing involves realistic and demanding
					activity that allows the concepts of leadership and teamwork to become
					apparent to members of the group. We build up an open, supportive
					atmosphere, in which leaders and team members can take risks, and learn
					to develop their attitude and skills. Such an atmosphere supports each
					individual's personal growth and reinforces the goals of the
					organization. </font>

			</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				<font face="Verdana">For twenty years, we have been meeting with professional
					learning teams, attempting to bring the most current understanding of:</font>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 9px; margin-bottom: 9px">
						<font face="Verdana">How to form and evaluate a group's commitment to the values of their
							organization. </font>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 9px; margin-bottom: 9px">
						<font face="Verdana">To determine the levels of trust among each team member. </font>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 9px; margin-bottom: 9px">
						<font face="Verdana">The team's willingness to be held accountable
							for the goals of the organization. </font>
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				<font face="Verdana">In
					providing the facilitation for these trainings we have discovered that it is critical to get the &#8220;right people on the bus and
					in the best seats.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>

			<p class="MsoNormal">
				<font face="Verdana">	Having a Leadership Consultant working with
					the executive learning team often helps the team to see how the
					unintended ripple of one team member can change the direction of and
					spirit of the entire team. The
					conversation begins with a simple question, &#8220;Where are we going?&#8221;&nbsp;
					During the day that question will be answered along with the question,
					&#8220;Who will share this journey with me?&#8221;&nbsp; Try thinking about how you would
					respond to those questions as one of you, in the role of captain,
					attempts to bring the yacht &#8220;about.&#8221;&nbsp; We promise an exhilarating
					experience, the beginning transformation of your executive team and a
					level of sailing activity that will build an institutional memory to
					last a lifetime.</font>
