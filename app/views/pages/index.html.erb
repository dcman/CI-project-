		Channel Islands center for leadership and teambuilding would like to offer your 
		organization the opportunity for better communication, improved leadership skills,
		and the general camaraderie that accompanies the art of sailing a
		vessel. Not only do groups learn the intricacies involved in properly
		sailing a boat, but they must do so cooperatively, as a group working together.
	</p>
	<p>
		Conversely, if you and your team would like to celebrate a job well done with a
		leisurely sail around our beautiful coast, allow us to indulge you! An entire day
		will be devoted to treating your group with the experience of enjoying our ocean
		from the deck of your very own chartered vessel. The local wildlife - dolphins,
		sea lions, many species of birds, and maybe even whales - adds dramatic detail
		to the gorgeous blue Pacific. Reward your crew with an experience they will never forget.
